# Birthday Reminder

This is a simple IFTTT webhook trigger combined with Gmail and Android SMS
actions. Create an applet with the following to recreate:

1. **Trigger** - receive a web request with a JSON payload (webhooks)
2. **Action 1** - send an email (gmail)
3. **Action 2** - send an SMS (android sms)

For the filter code, paste the code from the JavaScript file in and add your
email address(es) you want to send the alerts to.
